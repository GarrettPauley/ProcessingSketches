F : 
	Move forward a step length of d. 
	The state of the turtle changes to (x', y', angle')
	where x' = x + d * cos(angle) and y' = y + d * sin(angle)
	draw a line from (x,y) to (x', y')
f : 
	Move forward a step of length d, but do not draw a line. 

+ : 
	Turn counter-clockwise by angle. 
	The next state of the turtle is (x,y,theta + angle)
- : 
	Turn clockwise by angle 
	The next state of the turtle is (x,y,theta - angle)
Notation: 
angle (degrees)
